<p>This project studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces,
which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph em-
bedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes.  In this
paper, we implemented a network embedding method called the “LINE,” which is suitable for arbitrary types of informa-
tion networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function
that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the
limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference.  Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks,including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
